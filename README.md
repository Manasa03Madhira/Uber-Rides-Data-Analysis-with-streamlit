## Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Uber ride data and presents the results using **Streamlit** in a simple, web-based format.  
The goal is to help users gain quick insights into ride patterns such as **distance, time of travel, ride categories, and purposes**.

---

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the Uber ride dataset.
- Explore relationships between numerical and categorical variables.
- Generate clear and understandable **visualizations** for different ride parameters.
- Present the analysis results in a **user-friendly web application**.

---

## Problem Statement
Uber ride datasets contain a variety of features — distance, travel time, trip purpose, etc. Analyzing these relationships is crucial for understanding travel patterns.  
Traditional static analysis is not easily shareable; thus, we created a **web-based analysis app** that anyone can access to view the findings.

---

## Results Achieved
- Visualized the distribution of **miles traveled** and **time spent**.
- Generated **correlation heatmaps** to understand relationships between features.
- Created **count plots** for ride purposes and categories.
- Delivered a **shareable Streamlit web app** for easy viewing of results.

---

## Key Insights
- **Most frequent ride purpose:** Business and meeting-related rides dominate the dataset.
- **Ride distance trends:** Majority of trips are short-distance (<10 miles), suggesting frequent city commuting.
- **Peak usage times:** Early morning and evening hours see higher ride activity.
- **Strong correlations:** Distance traveled is moderately correlated with ride duration.
- **Category usage:** Personal rides tend to be longer in distance compared to business rides.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**  
- **Streamlit** – For building the web interface  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualizations
